# HTTP query-token authentication

Tracking discussion: <https://github.com/databendlabs/databend/issues/21043>.

## Protocol

Submit SQL using existing Basic, JWT, key-pair or native session authentication.
A created query returns an opaque token in `X-DATABEND-QUERY-TOKEN`, for both JSON
and Arrow results. Neither the JSON body nor Arrow schema metadata contains a
`query_token` field. Clients detect support by the response header; older clients
may ignore it and continue using existing authentication.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-DATABEND-QUERY-ID: <query-id>
X-DATABEND-QUERY-TOKEN: <query-token>
Cache-Control: no-store
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-DATABEND-QUERY-ID, X-DATABEND-QUERY-TOKEN
```

Save the query ID and token before reading the response body. For follow-ups:

```http
GET /v1/query/<query-id>/page/1
Authorization: Bearer <query-token>
X-DATABEND-AUTH-METHOD: query-token
```

Query-token authentication is restricted to:

| Method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/query/:id` |
| GET | `/v1/query/:id/page/:page_no` |
| GET or POST | `/v1/query/:id/final` |
| GET or POST | `/v1/query/:id/kill` |

It cannot submit SQL, log in/out, refresh sessions, heartbeat, upload data or
access metadata APIs. Session/temporary-table keepalive uses existing credentials;
query-token requests do not refresh the client session's Meta handle.

Only initial submission and eligible submission retries return the token header.
State, page (including page zero/retries), final and kill never return it. An absent
header on a follow-up must not clear the client's saved token.

## Ownership, routing and retries

The token is scoped to one query and its authenticated tenant/user. Request-body
settings such as `sandbox_tenant` may change the execution tenant, not the owner.
The route's query ID selects the query; `X-DATABEND-QUERY-ID` cannot override it.

Retain existing routing headers. Sticky forwarding precedes token validation on
the owning node; the expected-node header checks the destination, not ownership.
In management mode, an explicit tenant header must match the owner. Otherwise,
tenant headers follow the existing validation rules; headers ignored by Basic
in sandbox-enabled configurations are also ignored by query-token authentication.
An omitted tenant header is resolved from the validated query.

If the query has a client session, every query-token follow-up requires its
original cookie/session headers. Existing credentials may read state or kill a
same-owner query across sessions, but page/final require the original session.

A normally authenticated submission retry with the same client query ID may
return the retained page zero for the same tenant/user. Only a matching original
client session receives the token again. Another session may obtain the existing
result without the token; it is not automatically switched to the original session.

Losing the body after receiving headers still allows token-authenticated follow-ups.
Losing the entire response does not guarantee recovery. If it established the first
session, a retry may return page zero without restoring that session or its token.
Establish a session before submission when reliable session-bound retries are
needed. Do not automatically re-execute SQL when query state or its replayable
response is lost; it may already have run.

## Lifetime and errors

Each query has a random 256-bit token, validated without user/policy/token lookups
in Meta. New SQL still requires normal authentication and authorization. Tokens
remain valid after the user's credentials change or the user is deleted; this is
query-scoped access, not immediate per-request user revocation.

There is no independent token TTL or refresh endpoint. The token lasts as long as
the retained in-memory query record, including its closed retention period. It
does not reopen closed result pages. Removal, expiry or node restart loses both
query state and token; cross-node recovery and SQL replay are not provided.

- Missing node-local query state returns **404**, not a reason to refresh credentials.
- Invalid credentials, wrong tokens or ownership/session mismatches return **401**.
- A query absent during ordinary authentication remains **404** if inserted before
  the handler runs; that request must not access the newly inserted query.
- Query-ID existence is not hidden: a wrong token for a retained query gives 401,
  while a well-formed query-token request without retained query state gives 404.
- Duplicate `X-DATABEND-AUTH-METHOD` headers are rejected on authenticated endpoints.

## Transport and secrecy

Use TLS. Never put tokens in URLs or unredacted logs/traces. Token-bearing responses
use `Cache-Control: no-store`; server debug formatting and request-header logging
redact tokens. Proxies/APM must independently redact `Authorization` and the new
response header: an in-process sensitive flag does not travel over HTTP.

The query server emits `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`, but does not enable CORS
origins or credentials. Browser deployments must configure gateway/edge CORS and
preserve exposure of both query headers. Header delivery alone does not establish
safe caching, logging or cross-origin behavior.
